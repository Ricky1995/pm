The source of the project PrivacyMachine

Check out our [homepage](https://www.privacymachine.eu)!

This project requires freerdp 1.2.0-beta1 and a symlink to the X11-client in the "build" directory.
Also Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager 4.3.10 is required.
You need a Linux (tested with xubuntu 32bit) VM named "pm_base", with a xrdp server and the scrips from packaging/root_of_vm/ marked as executable for the user "pm".
Also a snapshot of "pm_base", in shutdown state, named "BaseForCloneOffline" is reqired.

This is a young alpha version so there are many bugs!
