When you browse the web, your data leaves a digital footprint. This footprint, connected by tracking technologies (called trackers), helps companies build a profile about you and how you interact with their sites and their competitors, allowing them to optimize their communications and site experience to reach you - and others like you - at the right place, at the right time.\n\nGhostery gives you the control to make informed decisions about the personal data you share with the trackers on the sites you visit.\n\nEnjoy a faster web\nSome sites take too long to load. This can be due to trackers weighing your system down. Ghostery allows you to block the offending trackers and significantly speed up your browsing.\n\nGet the content you want\nRemove page clutter so you can focus on the content you want.\n\nControl your data\nSometimes being connected can help you find the data you need quicker, like a location tracker that helps you find the closest cafe. Sometimes it spoils the fun, like a remarketing tracker, revealing the birthday present you wanted kept a surprise. Ghostery makes locking down your data easier.\n\nBe Informed, Take Control\nGhostery gives you the tools needed to understand the different types of trackers and how they may impact your overall browsing experience, putting the power directly in your hands.\n\nConnect and Learn More\nHow does Ghostery make money: https://www.ghostery.com/en/faq/how-does-ghostery-make-money-from-the-add-on/\nBlog: https://www.ghostery.com/en/intelligence/category/consumer-blog/\nFAQ: https://www.ghostery.com/en/faq/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostery\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ghostery\nSupport: https://www.ghostery.com/support","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/171/171549.png?src=api&modified=1460484377","width":"700","height":"476","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/171/171549.png?src=api&modified=1460484377","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"136","caption":"Pop-up box shows you the list of trackers on each site you visit."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/171/171552.png?src=api&modified=1460484377","width":"700","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/171/171552.png?src=api&modified=1460484377","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"135","caption":"Get a high level of control over your browsing experience from the Dashboard.

Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.\n\nClicking the flag icon loads our default action, Geotool, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and ISP. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:\n\n  • Site safety and malware checks\n  • Finding similar sites and reviews\n  • Automatic translation to your language\n  • SEO and web development research\n  • Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes\n  • Whois and DNS information\n  • Page code validation\n  • Quick URL shortening\n  • Copying a server's IP address or other info\n  • or you can create your own custom actions!\n\nFlagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by Maxmind. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/128/128264.png?src=api&modified=1394296408","width":"331","height":"342","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/128/128264.png?src=api&modified=1394296408","thumbnailWidth":"145","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Flagfox shows a flag icon in the location bar indicating the physical location of the current website's server.

Read the full Flagfox FAQ for more.\n\nCan Flagfox be useful for security?\nFlagfox can be used as a warning as to when a server isn't where it should be. If you end up at a site claiming to be an American bank, and it shows as Nigerian, then you may want to think twice. However, while this can be useful, Flagfox should not be relied on for this as a scam site can be in America just as easily as anywhere else.\n\nIs Flagfox sending information about where I'm browsing to some server?\nNot during normal browsing, no. Flagfox uses an internal database of IP address locations and does not send anything anywhere during normal browsing. If you use one of the lookup features, such as Geotool or whois, then that server will be sent the necessary info (IP address or domain name) that one time to do the lookup. There are some other extensions that have some features similar to Flagfox and they do, however, send all of your browsing habits to their server to provide their information. Flagfox respects users' privacy and makes a point to not do that. (see the Flagfox privacy policy)\n\nIt's showing the wrong flag!\nMaybe, but probably not. Sites can be hosted anywhere, they can have domains of any nationality, and can have multiple cache servers sending out the same site from different locations. Flagfox looks up the actual location of the server you're connected to using its IP address and a database maintained by Maxmind, which may or may not be where you'd expect it to be. (read this for more info)\n\nOne of the actions does something I don't like.\nEach action is its own site; we certainly don't run them all, just Geotool. Use Adblock Plus to deal with any minor ads if you need to and if any action breaks or starts doing something evil please report it to us. Flagfox is quite configurable, so if you don't like the actions included feel free to use your own. You can get more and suggest your own on our forums.\n\nDoes Flagfox support IPv6 yet?\nYes! Flagfox has full IPv6 support and monthly updates contain both IPv4 and IPv6 database updates.\n\nDon't post bug reports, support requests, or feature suggestions in reviews! This is NOT a forum and Mozilla will eventually delete non-review reviews. Post any questions, problems, or suggestions on the Flagfox forum or comment on the blog or email me directly.","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flagfox/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":647,"totalDownloads":23568555,"weeklyDownloads":12475,"dailyUsers":538202,"updateDate":1461155481000,"supportURL":"https://flagfox.net/forum"},{"id":"uBlock0@raymondhill.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-32.png?modified=1460210458","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-64.png?modified=1460210458"},"name":"uBlock Origin","type":"extension","version":"1.6.8","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gorhill/?src=api"},"description":"Finally, an efficient blocker.

Most common annoyance for YouTube videos is YouTube does not chose the best resolution for the currently playing video although there is another better video resolution already. Switching each video manually to a better resolution is awkward, difficult and time confusing. YouTube High Definition solves this common annoyance and loads all YouTube videos in Highest Definition automatically for you.\n\nBy default, YouTube High Definition plays the video in highest resolution automatically for you. But you can also specify YouTube High Definition to play all YouTube videos in a specific video resolution like 4K (2160p), 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p and 144p.\n\nYouTube High Definition not only loads the highest available resolution but plays the videos in Wide or Full Page style to better improve the High Definition experience. You can also choose the default YouTube videos player size, Shrink to play all YouTube videos in small mode. Also you can have all your YouTube videos in minimalist size by choosing Tiny video size option.\n\nAnother most common issue is the video annotations which can really expand and block YouTube videos and having them to turn off for each video is again difficult and time consuming. By YouTube High Definition, you can change the annotation settings for YouTube videos and can turn off annotations for all YouTube videos automatically by an easy single mouse click.\n\nYou can also change the video play behavior from YouTube High Definition settings. By default YouTube videos will start playing whenever the video player loads but you may want to auto stop YouTube all videos automatically and start playing and watching them whenever you want.\n\nHaving YouTube videos in sound is great but it can be disturbing especially in night mode. And some YouTube videos can change volume level time to time and adjusting volume to desired level again is unnecessary and annoying. YouTube High Definition can mute YouTube videos whenever the video player loads by default or have your YouTube videos specific volume level all the time.\n\nYouTube High Definition also improves listening music on YouTube by having all YouTube songs to have highest sound quality automatically for you.\n\nHaving all this settings are great for YouTube but there are millions of YouTube videos scattered around the web. You may also want to watch YouTube videos in High Definition on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. By adjusting YouTube High Definition settings you can also play all external (embedded) YouTube videos in High Definition, too and set the video playback behavior for all of them.\n\nYouTube High Definition also supports popular Flash add-on FlashBlock which is commonly used for YouTube so that FlashBlock users can also have high definition experience for YouTube videos.\n\nMultiprocess Firefox Electrolysis is being developed by Mozilla team and we have already support it beforehand so you can also have YouTube High Definition support for Firefox Electrolysis version.\n\nIf you may want to switch to Flash player to get more video quality options, you can use another add-on ( YouTube Flash Video Player ) from us.\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-flash-video-player/?src=userprofile\n\nIf you have any support questions, feature requests and bug reports, please do not hesitate to contact us by below support email address:\n\nsupport at barisderin dot com\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBaris Derin","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/104/104784.png?src=api&modified=1386577029","width":"256","height":"256","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/104/104784.png?src=api&modified=1386577029","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-high-definition/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://barisderin.com/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/418454/youtube_high_definition-45.1-sm+fx.xpi?src=api","size":149801,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-high-definition/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":224,"totalDownloads":4965336,"weeklyDownloads":25667,"dailyUsers":283090,"updateDate":1459272985000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"{b9db16a4-6edc-47ec-a1f4-b86292ed211d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3006-32.png?modified=1461741239","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3006-64.png?modified=1461741239"},"name":"Video DownloadHelper","type":"extension","version":"5.5.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mig/?src=api"},"description":"The easy way to download and convert Web videos from hundreds of YouTube-like sites.","fullDescription":"Video DownloadHelper is the most complete tool to extract videos and image files from Web sites and save them to your hard drive.\n\nJust surf the Web as you are used to, when DownloadHelper detects it can do something for you, the toolbar icon highlights and a menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nAs a bonus, Video DownloadHelper can also record Twitter Periscope. Just specify search terms and the add-on will capture over night related live streams.\n\nAs another bonus, you can also use Video DownloadHelper to capture a full browsing session, optionally highlighting the mouse position and generate a video file out of it. This is ideal to create Web a site demos as a video.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/howto.php.\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhqUx-b5-bE\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php.\n\nIf you want to test developments version, check this forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/video-downloadhelper-5.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), Google + or Facebook.\n\nIf you enjoy the free service from Video DownloadHelper, we would appreciate a donation (or BTC: 1Eqe8DN6uJwVcHoqyfCPpMy6Q5FzjqcWLZ) or leave a nice review here or on any other media.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","width":"200","height":"150","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","width":"327","height":"124","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"76","caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","width":"250","height":"200","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","thumbnailWidth":"188","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","width":"361","height":"289","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","thumbnailWidth":"187","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","width":"320","height":"317","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","thumbnailWidth":"151","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","width":"293","height":"250","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.png?src=api&modified=1426260067","thumbnailWidth":"176","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/420958/video_downloadhelper-5.5.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":673748,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":6364,"totalDownloads":208655672,"weeklyDownloads":257223,"dailyUsers":4462025,"updateDate":1460467386000,"supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php"},{"id":"jid1-xUfzOsOFlzSOXg@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/387/387429-32.png?modified=1458213616","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/387/387429-64.png?modified=1458213616"},"name":"Reddit Enhancement Suite","type":"extension","version":"4.6.1","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"honestbleeps","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/honestbleeps/?src=api"},"description":"NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nRES is a suite of tools to enhance your reddit browsing experience.","fullDescription":"NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nReddit Enhancement Suite is a suite of tools to enhance your Reddit browsing experience.

Using interactive visualizations, Lightbeam shows you the relationships between these third parties and the sites you visit.","fullDescription":"About this Add-on\nUsing interactive visualizations, Lightbeam enables you to see the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web. As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user. Using two distinct interactive graphic representations — Graph and List — Lightbeam enables you to examine individual third parties over time and space, identify where they connect to your online activity and provides ways for you to engage with this unique view of the Web.\n\nHow Lightbeam Works\nWhen you activate Lightbeam and visit a website, sometimes called the first party, the add-on creates a real time visualization of all the third parties that are active on that page. The default visualization is called the Graph view. As you then browse to a second site, the add-on highlights the third parties that are also active there and shows which third parties have seen you at both sites. The visualization grows with every site you visit and every request made from your browser. In addition to the Graph view, you can also see your data in a List view to drill down into individual sites.\n\nHow is my information stored?\nAll info generated and used for Lightbeam’s visualizations and features are only stored locally on your computer. You can save a copy of your connection history at any time, which is also where you can see the specific data collected by the add-on. You may also reset Lightbeam to erase your locally stored connection history, disable it to stop data collection or uninstall it to instantly remove all locally stored data related to Lightbeam. Additional information related to Lightbeam’s file format is available here\n\nThe origins of Lightbeam\nLightbeam began in July 2011 as Collusion, a personal project by Mozilla software developer Atul Varma. Inspired by the book The Filter Bubble, Atul created an experimental add-on to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web.\n\nIn February 2012, Gary Kovacs, Mozilla CEO at the time, introduced the Collusion add-on in a TED talk (now one of the most watched TED talks) about exposing online tracking.\n\nIn September 2012, Mozilla joined forces with students at Emily Carr University of Art + Design to develop and implement visualizations for the add-on. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Collusion has been re-imagined as Lightbeam and was launched in the fall of 2013.\n\nTo read more about the collaboration, please visit http://www.simcentre.ca\n\nFeedback\nYour input is valuable to us, so don’t forget to rate, review or give us feedback after using Lightbeam.

The download button is displayed below the video player and it looks like any other YouTube button. The extension doesn't include ads and only links to YouTube's download URLs.\n\nHow to use it? After installing the extension, go to YouTube.com and click a video. You'll notice a new \"Download\" button below the player. Click the button and you can select one of the formats that are available.\n\n\nWhat are the download options?\n\nHere are the formats you can download using this extension:\n\n* MP4 360p (480x270, 480x360) - all videos are available in this format. Use it if you want to play videos on an old mobile phone (iPhone 3GS, HTC Desire, Samsung Galaxy S2) or to save space.\n* MP4 720p (1280x720) - HD format, available for an increasing number of videos. Use this format if you want to play higher quality videos on a tablet, laptop or a phone with HD display.\n* just in case you need it, you can also download the highest-quality FLV version available: FLV 240p (426x240).\n* 480p and 1080p are no longer available as standalone videos downloaded from youtube.com. YouTube switched to adaptive streams and uses separate files for video and audio, which need to be merged to get a video file. This is more complicated and requires more advanced tools (ffmpeg), so I haven't added them yet.\n\n\nHow to watch the downloaded videos?\n\nAfter downloading videos, you can play them using free applications like:\n* VLC (Windows, Mac, Linux / play both MP4 and FLV videos) - recommended video player\n* Windows Media Player 12 for Windows 7/8 (play only MP4 videos)\n* iTunes and QuickTime Player (Windows, Mac / play only MP4 videos).\n\nUsing a different browser? The extension is based on a Greasemonkey script. If you use Chrome, Opera, Safari or Internet Explorer, install the userscript.\n\nCredits: The extension has been originally created by Arpit Kumar.\n\nSend bug reports to deadline.support@gmail.com or create a new issue at github.com.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/142/142584.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","width":"396","height":"346","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/142/142584.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","thumbnailWidth":"172","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The download button in the new YouTube interface"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/142/142588.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","width":"355","height":"250","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/142/142588.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"141","caption":"Click the button to see the video formats that are available."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/142/142582.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","width":"660","height":"446","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/142/142582.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"135","caption":"The download button in the new YouTube interface"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/122/122555.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","width":"475","height":"351","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/122/122555.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"148","caption":"The old download button."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/122/122556.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","width":"374","height":"136","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/122/122556.png?src=api&modified=1409755506","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"73","caption":"The old download button."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gantt/downloadyoutube","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/413801/download_youtube_videos_as_mp4-1.8.7-sm+fx.xpi?src=api","size":20681,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$2.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-youtube/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":400,"totalDownloads":20351699,"weeklyDownloads":83479,"dailyUsers":1069054,"updateDate":1458459678000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/gantt/downloadyoutube"},{"id":"{6c28e999-e900-4635-a39d-b1ec90ba0c0f}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/476/476246-32.png?modified=1457709616","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/476/476246-64.png?modified=1457709616"},"name":"Download Status Bar","type":"extension","version":"13.4.2.2","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Szalgiris","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/Szalgiris/?src=api"},"description":"If you are the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your downloads, \"Download Status Bar\" is the add-on you are looking for.","fullDescription":"Download Status Bar manages every aspect of your downloads (Launch, Show, Scan, Send To, Rename, Checksum, Pause, Resume, Cancel, Clean, Delete), generates Statistics from your Download actions, keeps the History of your previous session downloads and much more.

As the name suggest, Download Bar is the bar which is at bottom section of Firefox generally above Add-on Bar. Because Download Status Bar is user friendly and smart enough, Download Bar will only be visible when there is an active download. If there is no download to show, Download Bar hides itself automatically to preserve the web page area for you. And it will show itself again automatically when you start downloading any file from the web.\n\nBut if you want to view Download Bar even if there is no download, you can use below keyboard short-cuts:\n\nWindows: CTRL + ALT + D\n\nMac OS X: SHIFT + ALT + D\n\nLinux: (CTRL/CMD) + ALT + D\n\nYou can also use above keyboard short-cuts to hide Download Bar any time you wish. In other words those short-cuts work to toggle Download Bar for you. As another option, you can toggle Download Bar by Download Status Bar menu option under Tools menu of Firefox.\n\nAfter you open up Download Bar, you will notice Downloads button on the left and Clear button on the right side of the bar. Downloads button is the main button of Download Status Bar add-on which you can click to open up Add-on Context Menu. Clear button is used to clear all completed downloads from Download Bar by a mouse click.\n\nClicking on Download button will provide Add-on Context Menu as described below:\n\n    Options: This menu option will open up add-on Options window where you can customise the add-on according to your needs.\n    Statistics: This menu option will open up Statistics page which will generate Statistics details and graphs for your previous Download actions.\n    Show Download History: This menu option will open up default Firefox History Library in case you may want to refer to your Downloads as a list of window.\n    Open Download Tab: This menu option will open up default Firefox History Library as a browser tab.\n    Downloads: This menu provides you Pause All Downloads, Resume All Downloads, Cancel All Downloads and Clear All Downloads options to manage your downloads in batch.\n    Help: This menu option will open up Help page of Download Status Bar where you can get details about the add-on and how to use it in an efficient way.\n    Close Bar: This menu option will close up Download Bar for you.\n\nWhen you download files from web, Download Status Bar automatically places download items in Download Bar. Below are some example software from Mozilla to download.
