Here is the python3 script to build the template VM.
This script only works on Linux (tested on debian jessie)

1) Make shure you have installed VirtualBox, python3, ssh and grml2iso (in package grml2usb)

2) Download a grml64 ISO from http://grml.org/download/

3) Use this guide to customize the ISO with your ssh-key: http://blog.grml.org/archives/367-Create-a-Grml-ISO-image-with-your-own-ssh-keys-for-password-less-login.html

4) Change the general configuration parameter in build_base-disk.py (line: 200 - 235)

5) Execute "python3 build_base-disk.py"

6) If the build succeeds remove the timestamps from the .txt and .vdi files and move them to the build/pm folder 

Now you are able to start the PrivacyMachine with the builded base-disk.vdi



In case of failure nothing gets cleand up so you can debug,
this means you have to cleanup by your own:

1) In VirtualBox: delete the build-VM and remove the broken base-disk.vdi from index
2) make shure the VirtualBox-folder of the build-VM is removed
